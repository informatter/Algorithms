# Algorithms and Data Structures

The aim of this repo is to implement and learn different algorithms and data structures that are fundamental in Computer Science to solve computational problems. The repo will implement a collection of algorithms from books: 

-*"Learning Algorithms Through Programming and Puzzle Solving"* by Alexander S. Kulikov, Pavel Pevzner 
-*"Introduction To Algorithms" *3rd edition* by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest and Clifford Stein
